A premium add-on pack for Store Locator Plus that adds SEO friendly store pages generated from the location data.

== Description ==

You can have a WordPress page for each store location on your map turning your location data into SEO friendly content.  Store Pages are a special page type that is fully integrated with WordPress,  but you manage them through Store Locator Plus.  Store Pages also have their own taxonomy (category system) so you can manage Store Page categories without affecting the rest of your site.
